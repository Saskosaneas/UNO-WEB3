Web3 Course Assignment 3

# Uno Against Other Players

Implement an Uno game that works in the browser. The game should allow playing against players through a server.

## Requirements

### Must have

- The application must allow playing a round of Uno against 1-3 human opponents
- The play must proceed according to the official Uno rules
- The application must have at least the same features as assignment 2
- The application must allow users to identify themselves
- The application must allow users to create a new game
- The application must allow users to join an existing game
- The server must notify the participants in the game every time something happens in the game
- The server must use GraphQL as the communication protocol.

### Should have

- The server should keep track of players and scores in a database (or file)
- The application should implement user registration and login

### Could have

- The application could allow playing an entire game (with score) of Uno against 1-3 human opponents
- If the game is an entire game, the server could allow saving the game after a round and resume it later

Things to consider:

- What is the best way to handle notifications to the client?
- What is the best way to save to database?

# The required code

The client should be implemented using Vue.js. It can be either Options or Composition API but be consistent. If you want to try out server-side rendering, feel free, but it's not a requirement.

The server should be implemented as a GraphQL server using Apollo Server.

# The hand-in

- Groups: 2-4 people.
- Hand-in a zip file with the project.
